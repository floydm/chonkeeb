Presenting the chonkey bluetooth handwired split keyboard, the Chonkeeb! The design was more of an accident really. she was originally supposed to house flat LiPo batteries for a more low profile chassis, but I was budget constrained, and the 18650 batteries were more affordable. Underestimated how chonkey the case would turn out trying to fit these batteries, and voila here she is in all her glory!
